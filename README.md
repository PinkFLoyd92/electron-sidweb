## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)
Basically we are going to receive notifications in our computer when the app is launched, also we have automatic login for our ESPOL account. This project is just done for learning purposes.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn how to create a desktop application using Electron, also I wanted to apply IPC in anyway.

## Installation

1. Run ```npm install``` in the root folder and install ```electron-prebuilt``` too. 
2. Also in order to login automatically you need to specify your credentials in a config file named ```config``` in the root path.
3. Then run ```npm start``` so you run the project.
